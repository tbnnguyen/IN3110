The picture used is the default size of "beatles.jpg" which has size of (480, 640, 3) 

Running the function 10 times with timeit took 1.52 sec, compared to 59.61 sec with 
function in "blur_1.py" and the same image. Numba is a bit slower than Numpy that used
0.42 sec. Note that the first run is a lot slower than the consecutive runs.

Advantages with Numba is that is easy to use, as it doesn't require you to modify the code 
in the first script (blur_1).

Disadvantages is that it "works like magic" which can make it difficult to bugtest and 
creates an extra dependency.
